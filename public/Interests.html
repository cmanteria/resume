            <p>I love to cook. It's a passion. It's a way to show love for those in my home and a way to provide for our
                daily need to eat. It's a creative outlet and allows me to continue to learn and grow skills that I just
                adore. From daily cooking and baking to craft cooking such as sausage making, sourdough obsessions, and 
                of course real barbeque and meat curing I love to dabble in all of it, much to the delight of my friends 
                and family

            <p>Books have always been something that I love. More often then not I was delving into some long lost land
                or time forgotten with a fantasy or science fiction novel. As I have gotten older, I have continued this
                passion but find that I have added in texts on philosophy, government, religion, and personal growth. I've
                been lucky enough to carve out this space as both my library and office where I get to work every day.

                <p>While all of these charities are near and dear to my heart, this charity was formed by Coldwell Banker 
                    American Homes, a company I have worked for as an agent, team leader, technology advisor and Chief 
                    Technology Officer, to provide assistance to anyone in the American Homes family and local community. 
                    100% profits go back to our local community here on Long Island and in the 5 Boroughs.</p>
